# Python Crash Course Exercises and Examples

This repository contains a collection of exercises and examples that I have completed while studying the book **"Python Crash Course"** by Eric Matthes. The collection starts at Chapter 8, "Functions". I'm using this repository as a "progress bar" of my learning.

## Structure

The repository is organized into chapters, with each chapter containing its respective exercises and examples. The directory structure is as follows:
